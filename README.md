# speckle-email-templates

Uses the [MJML](https://mjml.io/) framework to build e-mail templates without dealing with a lot of the complexity that often arises out of doing so.

## Development

Use VSCode and make sure you install the recommended MJML extension. Through this extension you can will get syntax highlighting in .mjml files and also the option to trigger a live preview right from the specific .mjml file.

## Building

Run `yarn build` to build everything. Run `yarn watch` to build in watch mode.

## Testing

You can use a trial for one of these kinds of services: https://www.emailonacid.com/. The goal here is to evaluate that the template looks right in different kinds of e-mail clients and their versions.
